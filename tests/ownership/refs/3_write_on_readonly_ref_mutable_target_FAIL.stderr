error[E0594]: cannot assign to `*ref_baz`, which is behind a `&` reference
  --> tests/ownership/refs/3_write_on_readonly_ref_mutable_target_FAIL.rs:10:5

10 |     *ref_baz = 42;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `ref_baz` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be written
   |
help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference
