error[E0382]: assign to part of moved value: `target`
  --> tests/ownership/value/3_instance_newentry_modify_FAIL.rs:11:5
   |
7  |     let mut target = Boo { u: 0 };
   |         ---------- move occurs because `target` has type `Boo`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
8  |
9  |     let target_entry = target;
   |                        ------ value moved here
10 |
11 |     target.u = 42;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ value partially assigned here after move
   |
note: if `Boo` implemented `Clone`, you could clone the value

4  | struct Boo { u: usize }
   | ^^^^^^^^^^ consider implementing `Clone` for this type
